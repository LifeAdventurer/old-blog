    <title>Why should you do light viewing early every day for five minutes?</title>
    <url>/2023/04/09/Why-should-you-do-light-viewing-early-every-day-for-five-minutes/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>  This is not some woo biology thing. This is grounded in the core of
our physiology. There are literally hundreds if not thousands of quality
peer-reviewed papers showing that light viewing early in the day is the
most powerful stimulus for wakefulness throughout the day. It has a
<strong>powerful positive impact</strong> on your ability <strong>to
fall and stay asleep at night</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="how-to-do-it-and-when">How to do it? and when?</h4>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>First hour after waking</li>
<li>5 ~ 15 minutes after waking</li>
<li>Bright, clear day</li>
<li>Low solar angle → Sun is low or the sun is getting overhead</li>
<li>Don't look at the sun directly</li>
<li>Totally fine to blink</li>
</ul>
<p>  Try and get outside ideally within the first <strong>5 minutes of
waking</strong> or maybe it's 15 minutes, but certainly within the
<strong>first hour after waking</strong>. And if it's a bright, clear
day, the <strong>sun is low in the sky</strong> or the sun is starting
to get <strong>overhead</strong> what we call a <strong>low solar
angle</strong>, then I know I'm getting outside at the right time. If
there's cloud cover and I can't see the sun, I also know I'm doing a
good thing because it turns out, especially on cloudy days, you want to
get outside and get as much light energy or photons in your eyes.</p>
<p>  Let's say it's a very clear day and I can see where the sun is. I
do not need to stare directly into the sun. If it's very low in the sky,
I might do that because it's not going to be very painful for my eyes.
However, if the sun is a little bit brighter and a little bit higher in
the sky, sometimes it could be painful to look at. So the way to get
this sunlight viewing early in the day is to look toward the sun. If
it's too bright to look at directly, then don't do that. Just look
toward it but not directly at it, and it's definitely fine to blink. In
fact, I encourage you to blink whenever you feel the impulse to
blink.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="how-it-works">How it works?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>  Never look at any light, sunlight, or otherwise, that is so bright
that it's painful to look at because it can damage your eyes. But for
this morning's sunlight viewing, it's best to not wear sunglasses. It is
fine to wear eyeglasses or contact lenses, so-called corrective lenses.
In fact, those will serve you well in this practice because they will
focus the light onto your neural retina and that melanopsin
intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells. If your eyeglasses or
contact lenses have UV protection, that's fine. There are so many
different wavelengths of light coming from the sun and they are brighter
enough that they will trigger mechanisms that you want to activate at
this early time of day.</p>
<p>  The bright artificial light in your home environment is not going
to be sufficiently bright to turn on the cortisol mechanism and the
other wake-up mechanisms that you need. Early in the day, right around
waking, you need a lot of light, a lot of photons, and a lot of light
energy. Artificial lights generally just won't accomplish what you need
them to accomplish, but at night, even a bit of artificial light can
really mess up your circadian, your 24-hour clocks, and all these
mechanisms that we're talking about.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>  Don't try to get this sunlight exposure through a car's windshield
or a window whether or not it's tinted or otherwise. It takes far too
long, it's simply not going to trigger the relevant mechanisms. You
would be standing there all day trying to get enough light into your
eyes from the morning sunlight and by then the sun will have already
moved from low solar angel to overhead. And it won't work for all sorts
of mechanisms related to your circadian rhythm functions.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="how-much-light-viewing-do-you-need">How much light viewing do
you need?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>  This is going to vary depending on the person and place, literally
where you live on earth, whether or not there's a lot of tree cover,
whether or not you have sensitive eyes or less sensitive eyes. It's
really hard to give an absolute prescriptive, but we can give some
general guidelines. In general, on a clear day, meaning no cloud cover
or minimal cloud cover, you want to get this sunlight exposure to your
eyes for about 5 minutes or so. On a day when there's cloud cover, the
sun is just peeking through the clouds, or it's more dense cloud cover,
you want to get about 10 minutes of sunlight exposure to your eyes early
in the day.</p>
<p>  This is really the foundational power tool for ensuring a great
night's sleep and for feeling more awake during the day.</p>
